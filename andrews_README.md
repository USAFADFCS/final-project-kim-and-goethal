# Andrew's Gide to how to use the project
1. After navigating to the project folder via terminal, type in python3 andrewtesting17.py to start the program.
2. Go to PicoCTF and select a web challenge (preferably SSTI1, Cookie Monster Secret Recipe, WebDecode, Unminify, Local Authority, Inspect HTML, Includes, dont-use-client-side, Insp3ct0r, where are the robots, or SQLiLite), copy the url to the challenge, and paste it into the terminal where the system is running and hit enter.
3. Watch as the agentic system solves the CTF challenge.

Note: All of the testing was done on an ARM based macbook, so your milage may vary if you are using a Windows or x86 device.
